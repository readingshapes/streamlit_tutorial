# feedback: day 4 - copy/paste chart and modify to show change in median income. this is not really change in median income, it's just income by year
# jumps from training wheels to a jet - there's no walk through of the in-between of streamlit. i could just read the documentation if i wanted to do research on my own

# day 6:
# an app i could create right now
# an app i would like to build but is too complex for me now

# instructions

# cd /home/pants/Documents/streamlit_tutorial

### **Activate your virtual environment**
# In your project directory, run:

# `source .venv/bin/activate`

### You'll need to do this each time you open a new terminal.

### **Run the demo app**
#### Once your virtual environment is active, type:

# `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
