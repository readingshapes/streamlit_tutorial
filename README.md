# streamlit_tutorial

This repository walks you through creating and deploying a data app in Python using
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It contains:
  * A motivating example. What problem does Streamlit solve?
  * A small demo app to get you started. This app contains interesting, real-world data.
  * Instructions for installing, running, and modifying the demo app on your local machine.
  * Exercises for improving the app. Solving these problems will help you learn Streamlit.
  * Instructions for deploying your finished app to the internet. This will let you share it with friends and family.

You can view the final app you will build [here](https://arilamstein-tutorial.streamlit.app/).

### Workshop Length

In a recent workshop an experienced developer finished the workshop in about 90 minutes
with minimal help from me. The less-experienced developers tended to get "stuck" at certain points and needed help to
overcome the issues they encountered. 

If you are going through this tutorial on your own and get stuck, my advice is to first see if google or an LLM can help
you. If that doesn't work, see if a more experienced developer can answer your question.  

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have basic proficiency with the command line, git, and Python. 

### Motivating Example

I frequently use Jupyter Notebooks to convey analytical results. Each notebook typically imports a dataset,
transforms it, and then presents a visualization or two. In short, each notebook tells a story about a dataset.

Streamlit lets me convert the code in my notebooks to a web application. Instead of telling a story, I am now giving people a
tool to explore the dataset themselves. 

Click [here](motivating_example.ipynb) to see an example.

### Setup

This tutorial uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the project's virtual environment. To install uv:
1. Open a terminal.
1. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation). 
1. Restart your terminal.

Next fork and clone the repository:
1. Fork this repository in Github
   ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=desktop)).
1. Clone your fork to your local machine ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

Finally, create the virtual environment for the project:
1. In your project directory, type `uv sync`. This will install the version of Python I used when creating this project.
   It will also create a
   virtual environment in the project's `.venv` directory. That virtual environment will contain all the packages you
   need to complete the workshop.

The above instructions need to be executed just once.

### Run the Demo App

After completing the steps in the "Setup" section you can run the demo app.

1. First activate the project's virtual environment: In the terminal, navigate to the project's directory and type `source .venv/bin/activate`.
1. Then type `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.

A browser should open that contains the demo app. It should look like this:

</p>

### Streamlit Basics

We're now ready to start working with code! Let's start with the basics.

1. While the app is running, open the file [streamlit_app.py](streamlit_app.py). Can you guess what each line of
   the file does?
1. Streamlit apps can reload after you make changes to the source code. That is, you don't need to stop and restart the app to
   see the result of your changes. 
1. While the app is running, change the text in the
   `st.header` call (line 7) to be "Changes in US State Demographics Over Time". Save the file. 
1. The app should now have
   a button in the upper right that says "Rerun". Click it. The app should update with the new text.
   
### Modify the App 

The best way to learn Streamlit is to solve small, real-world problems on an existing app. Open the file
[exercises.md](exercises.md) and try to complete the tasks listed there. They ask you to modify the demo app by:
1. Adding a new graph.
1. Adding a new input widget.
1. Using the value from input widgets when creating a graph. 
1. Using tabs to make the app easier to navigate. 

These are common tasks when working in Streamlit. If you get stuck, check my solutions in `solution_app.py`.

After you have finished the exercises, commit your changes and push them to Github.

### Deploy Your App

Streamlit makes it easy to share your app with others. When your app is running, there should be a "Deploy" button in
the upper right. Click it and follow the instructions that appear.

I encourage you to share your app with friends and family!

### A More Complex App

This tutorial is based on the first app I built with Streamlit. I call that app the "Covid Demographics Explorer", and
it helps people understand how US counties changed since Covid-19. You can view it
[here](https://census-explorer.streamlit.app/). 

While that app is more complex than the app you just built, most of the complexity is in the data and visualizations.
That is, it uses
Streamlit in much the same way as the app you just created:
  * It loads data on startup.
  * It has input widgets.
  * Those widgets determine what graphs are shown.
  * The graphs are separated by tabs.

You now know enough Streamlit to build and deploy fairly interesting apps. I look forward to seeing what you create!

### Conclusion

Congratulations: You have now cloned, modified, and deployed your first Streamlit app!
