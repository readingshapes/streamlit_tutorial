**Subject**: Day 2: Make Your First Streamlit Edit 💡

Yesterday you ran your first Streamlit app. Today you’ll open the actual code—and make your first change.

This is a small step, but it’s a meaningful one. You’re not just running code anymore. You’re shaping it.

## 🔍 What You’ll Do

1. Open the file `streamlit_app.py`
2. Read through the code and guess what each line does
3. Make a small edit to personalize the app
4. See your change reflected instantly

## 🧵 Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Open the file.** In your project folder, find and open `streamlit_app.py`.

**2. Read the code.** Take a moment to scan the file. Can you guess what each line does? Don’t worry if you’re unsure—just noticing patterns is a great start.

**3. Make a change.** Find the line that starts with `st.header`. It should be around line 7. Change the text to: "Changes in US State Demographics Over Time".

**4. Save and rerun.** Save the file. Streamlit will detect that file changed. In your browser, a button that says "Rerun" will appear in the upper right corner of the app. Click it. You should see your new header appear instantly.

## 💬 Why This Matters
Streamlit is designed for fast feedback. You don’t need to restart the app—just save and rerun. That makes it easy to experiment and learn by doing.

This tiny change also proves something important: You can read, understand, and modify a real Streamlit app.

Tomorrow, we’ll start making deeper changes. But for today, enjoy this win—you’ve taken your first step as a Streamlit developer.

Nice work,
