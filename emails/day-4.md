**Subject**: Day 4: Time to Modify the App 🧠

You’ve already set up your environment, run the demo app, and made your first code edit. Today, we take the next big step: modifying the app to make it your own.

This is the heart of the course. Everything so far has built toward this moment.

## 🧪 Your Exercises for Today
Open `streamlit_app.py` and complete the following tasks:

**1. Add a second graph** that shows the change in Median Household Income over time. You can do this by copy-pasting the
   code that makes the Population graph and modifying it slightly. Place the new graph below the Population graph.

**2. Add a second select box** that lets users select which demographic to display (i.e., Population or Income).

**3. Use the value from both select boxes** to determine which graph to show. For example, if the user selects "New York"
   and "Median Household Income", display only the Income graph for New York.

**4. Separate the graph and table into tabs** to improve the layout. Create two tabs: one called "Graphs" and the other called "Table". Hint: look at the example code on Streamlit's documentation page for tabs ([link](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.tabs)).

## 💬 Why This Matters
These aren’t toy exercises. They mirror the kinds of tasks you’ll face in real-world projects—adding interactivity, customizing visuals, and organizing content for clarity.

Take your time. If something doesn’t work, that’s okay. Every bug is a learning opportunity.

You’re building something real now. Keep going.
